letimer_one_shot_output_compare

This project demonstrates output compare in EM2 using the LETIMER.
The project initializes the letimer in one-shot mode, and expansion 
header pin toggles REPEAT_COUNT times while staying in a low energy mode.

Note: On EFR32xG21 devices, oscillators and clock branches are automatically 
turned on/off based on demand from the peripherals.  As such, writes to clock 
enable bits are unnecessary and have no effect on xG21 devices. 

Note: On xG22 devices, DEBUG and LETIMER are on the same power 
sub-domain, which means that because LETIMER is enabled in EM2, that power 
sub-domain remains powered in EM2, powering both LETIMER and DEBUG.  Thus, the 
EM2DBGEN bit in EMU_CTRL is not set in the example for xG22. 

Note: On EFR32xG23 devices and later, the DEBUG block on the device is powered 
off by default in low power modes EM2 and below.  The EM2DBGEN bit in EMU_CTRL
can be set to keep DEBUG powered on in EM2, and this has been done in the
example for xG23, xG24, and  xG25, where DEBUG and LETIMER are on different 
power sub-domains. When the EM2DBGEN bit is set, the device will exhibit 
slightly higher EM2 current consumption than when EM2DBGEN is not set.
