timer_period_measurement_polled

This project demonstrates polled period measurement using the TIMER module. 
TIMER is initialized for input capture on Compare/Capture channel 0 for falling 
edge capture. The program waits for a falling edge and then the captured edge is 
read from CC0 and compared with the previously captured edge to calculate the 
period. The measured period is stored in the measuredPeriod global variable in 
units of microseconds.

Example: for a 1 kHz input signal, the measuredPeriod variable will equal 1000.

Note: The range of frequencies this program can measure accurately is limited.
The minimum measurable period is around 3 microseconds, or 333 kHz. At higher
frequencies accuracy is diminished due to dropout, and above 333 kHz the 
interrupt execution time is longer than the signal period. For methods to 
measure shorter periods, see the timer_pulse_capture example.

Note: For EFR32xG21 radio devices, library function calls to CMU_ClockEnable() 
have no effect as oscillators are automatically turned on/off based on demand 
from the peripherals; CMU_ClockEnable() is a dummy function for EFR32xG21 for 
library consistency/compatibility.
