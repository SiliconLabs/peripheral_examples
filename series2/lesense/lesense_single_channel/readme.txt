lesense_single_channel

This project demonstrates the usage of LESENSE to sample a single channel
using ACMP. The LESENSE uses the ACMP peripheral to sample the input state of 
push button 0, and will trigger an interrupt to toggle LED0 when push button 0
is pressed.

Note: In project where the device enters EM2 or lower, an escapeHatch
      routine is usually recommended to prevent device lock-up. This example has
      implemented a escapeHatch, where if the user holds down push-button 1 when
      resetting the device, the escapeHatch will hold the device in EM0 state
      to allow debug connection

How to test:
1. Build the project and download it to the starter kit.
2. The LED0 should be off right now with a current consumption of around 3.8uA.
3. Press push button 0, LED0 should turn on.
4. Release push button 0 and press it again, LED0 should turn off.
5. Enter debug mode and place a break point inside the LESENSE_IRQHandler().
6. Repeat step 3 and observe the interrupt handler firing each time.

Peripheral Used:
CMU   - LFRCO @ 32768 Hz
ACMP  - used to sample push-button 0 input state
GPIO  - LED0 configured as output
LESENSE - controls ACMP to sample push-button 0 on selected LESENSE channel
