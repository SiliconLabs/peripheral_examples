em1_dcdc

This project demonstrates the datasheet current consumption 
configuration and current consumption numbers in EM1 Energy Mode.

Note: Default project gives EM1 current consumption numbers when DCDC is enabled 
with all peripherals disabled and HFRCO running at 38 MHz. 
To get EM1 energy consumption at different HFRCO frequencies change HFCRO DPLL 
band in line 70 of main.c or line 61 in main_xg25.c.

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Update the kit's firmware from the Simplicity Launcher (if necessary)
2. Build the project and download to the Wireless Starter Kit, then exit
   from the debugger.
3. Open the Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler.  Select Start Energy Capture
   from the Profiler menu and restart the wireless starter kit using Reset Pin.
4. Zoom in on the Y-axis (current) and observe the change in current draw.

================================================================================

Note for Testing on xG25:
Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler tool only measures the VMCU current. VMCU 
only powers IOVDD0-1 and the serial flash on BRD4270B. The 3.6 V LDO powers the
rest of the rails on the radio board. In the datasheet, the current 
consumption with DCDC test conditions requires IOVDD0-2, RFVDD, and DVDD to be 
powered by the output of the DCDC. Keep in mind, due to the design of the radio
board (BRD4270B), this example does not replicate the datasheet test conditions
followed for current consumption with DCDC. Although RFVDD and DVDD are powered 
by the output of the DCDC, IOVDD0-1 is powered by VMCU on the radio board and 
IOVDD2 is powered by the USB_VREG. To measure the 3.6V LDO current, the 
following extra steps must be taken.
1. Complete Steps 1 and 2 from the "How to Test" section above.
2. Select the device in the Debug Adapters pane within the Simplicity Studio
   Launcher view. 
2. Select the Documentation tab, then check the Schematic and Layout file 
   resource checkbox. Open the schematic and assembly files for BRD4270B.
3. Resistor R247 is a 0 Ohm resistor that can be removed to  measure the 
   current consumption of the device. Search for this resistor in the assembly 
   file to determine its position on the board. This resistor is present on the 
   underside of BRD4270B. 
4. Remove R247 and solder two leads to each pad where R247 was previously. 
   Connect these leads to a multimeter to measure the current consumption of the 
   device. 

Note for Testing on xG27:
On BRD4194A, VMCU is a 3.3V supply that powers AVDD and IOVDD on xG27.
In the datasheet, current consumption test conditions have AVDD and IOVDD
powered by either the DC-DC at 1.8V, an external 1.8V supply, 
or an external 3.0V supply. Due to the design of the radio board, this 
board does not replicate the datasheet test conditions for current consumption,
and the measured value may differ from the datasheet value.  
   
Note for Testing on xG28:
On BRD4400C, there is a diversity SPDT switch on the 2.4 GHz radio output that
will consume ~63 uA of additional current when supplied power via logic high on
GPIO PD02. The pin is configured in disabled mode (high-Z) by default, thus SPDT
switch is powered down by default. Be advised that when PD02 is driven to logic
high, observed current consumption will be higher than what is specified in the 
EFR32ZG28 device datasheet due to this additional integrated circuit.
