em23_voltage_scaling

This project demonstrates the use of EM2/EM3 voltage scaling on Series 2
EFR32 devices.  Note that this differs from the voltage scaling
functionality on Series 1 devices where a single setting (VS2 or VS0)
applies in all operating modes.  For Series 2 devices, separate examples
are provided for EM0/1 and EM2/3 voltage scaling.

In this example, the CPU (a) configures the BURTC to request interrupts
at 4-second intervals, (b) sets the RAM to power-down all blocks when
entering EM2/3 except for the single 16 KB block holding the stack, and
(c) enters EM3 with VS2 voltage scaling.  Upon wake-up, EM23 voltage
scaling is switched to VS0, and the device re-enters EM3.  Toggling
between VS2 and VS0 happens every four seconds so that it can observed
in Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler or by powering the WSTK from a
bench supply with a digital multimeter in series and sliding the
3-position BAT/USB/AEM switch from the AEM to the BAT position.

The savings when running at VS0 (0.9 V) vs. VS2 (1.1 V) in EM3 with the
ULFRCO providing the clock for the BURTC is on the order of 40% (1.45 uA
vs. 2.52 uA) when this example is run on EFR32MG22 revision C silicon
and observed using using Energy Profiler.

When EFR32xG22 and later devices enter EM2/3, the clock to the CPU debug
block is stopped, effectively dropping the host OC debugger connection.
This examples includes an "escape hatch" mechanism to pause the device so
that a debugger can connect in order to erase flash.  To use this, press
the PB0 push button and, while holding the button, press the RESET button
in the lower right corner of the WSTK.  Upon releasing the RESET button,
the device runs code that sees that PB0 is depressed, turns on LED0, and
issues a breakpoint instruction to halt the CPU.  At this point, a
the debugger connection can be resumed to erase flash, etc.

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Update the kit's firmware from the Simplicity Launcher (if necessary)
2. Build the project and download to the Wireless Starter Kit, then exit
   from the debugger.
3. Open the Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler.  Select Start Energy Capture
   from the Profiler menu.
4. Zoom in on the Y-axis (current) and observe the change in current draw
   as the devices toggles between VS2 and VS0 every four seconds.
