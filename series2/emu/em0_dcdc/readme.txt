em0_dcdc

This project demonstrates the datasheet current consumption 
configuration and current consumption numbers in EM0 Energy Mode.

Note: Default project gives EM0 current consumption numbers when DCDC is enabled 
with all peripherals disabled, HFRCO running at 38 MHz and CPU running while loop
from flash.
To get EM0 energy consumption at different HFRCO frequencies change HFCRO DPLL 
band in line 73 of main.c.

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Update the kit's firmware from the Simplicity Launcher (if necessary)
2. Build the project and download to the Wireless Starter Kit, then exit
   from the debugger.
3. Open the Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler.  Select Start Energy Capture
   from the Profiler menu and restart the wireless starter kit using Reset Pin.
4. Zoom in on the Y-axis (current) and observe the change in current draw.
