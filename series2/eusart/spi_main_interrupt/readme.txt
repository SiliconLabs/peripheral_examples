eusart_spi_main_interrupt

This project demonstrates interrupt-driven operation of the EUSART in
synchronous main (formerly master) mode.  EUSART0/1 is configured for
SPI-compatible operation at 1 Mbps.  Compatibility with the Synchronous
Peripheral Interface standard implies a word size of 8 data bits transmitted
and received MSB-first.

An output buffer is filled with 10 bytes of data (which can be changed by
modifying BUFLEN).  The EUSART chip select pin (controlled as a GPIO), is
asserted (driven low) to notify a secondary (formerly slave) device that data
will soon be on the way.  This example inserts a delay of around 15 us after
chip select assertion in order to allow the secondary device (expected to
be one of the equivalent EFM32/EFR32 interrupt-driven examples) to exit its
low-power state and pre-load its transmit buffer with the first byte of data
to be returned.

The first byte of data to be transmitted (outbuf[0]) is written to the
EUSARTn_TXDATA register, after which the device enters the EM1 low-energy
mode.  While the CPU is halted, the EUSART drives the CLK pin such that
each pulse causes the byte written to TXDATA to be shifted out while an
incoming byte is shifted into RXDATA one bit at a time.

Once the last CLK pulse has been driven, the EUSART asserts its transmit
complete flag (EUSARTn_STATUS_TXC) and its associated interrupt request
(EUSARTn_IF_TXC).  This causes the processor to exit the EM1 low-energy
mode and enter the EUSARTn_TX_IRQHandler() where the newly received byte
is written to the inbuf[] array.  If characters remain to be sent, the
next byte is written to TXDATA, and the TXC interrupt flag is cleared
before exiting the IRQ handler.

Until BUFLEN characters have been transferred, the device repeatedly
enters EM1, waiting for the transmit complete interrupt to wake it up in
order to save the most recently received character.

After BUFLEN characters have been transmitted and received, the chip
select is de-asserted (driven high).  A breakpoint can be set at the
call to GPIO_PinOutSet() when the chip selected is de-asserted to
inspect the received data.

Before repeating the process, another delay (around 8 us) is inserted
because the secondary implementations running on slower devices (e.g.
either lower clock rate or lower IPC CPU such as the Cortex-M0+) need
extra time to prepare the input and output buffers for the next round of
bytes to be transferred.  Without this delay, these devices effectively
skip receiving data on every other chip select assertion.

Peripherals Used:

GPIO
EUSART0/1

The CMU is used indirectly via the EUSART_SpiInit() function to calculate
the divisor necessary to derive the desired bit rate.

Test Procedure:

1. This example requires two Starter Kits (STKs) for any two EFM32 or
   EFR32 devices.  Build the spi_secondary_interrupt example and download
   it to the first board.

2. Build this project and download it to the second board.

3. Connect the Expansion Header pins from the main to the secondary board
   as follows:

      Main WSTK         Secondary WSTK
    -------------       --------------
    Pin 1  (GND)  <---> Pin 1  (GND)
    Pin 4  (MOSI) <---> Pin 4  (MOSI)
    Pin 6  (MISO) <---> Pin 6  (MISO)
    Pin 8  (SCLK) <---> Pin 8  (SCLK)
    Pin 10 (CSn)  <---> Pin 10 (CSn)

   NOTE: Some radio boards do not follow this convention for SPI
   pin-mapping.  See the supported board list below for specific
   assignments.

4. Before running the example, set a breakpoint on the GPIO_PinOutSet
   function call that de-asserts the chip select.  Examine the inbuf[]
   array to see the received data from the secondary.  This example
   transfers data continuously but will not start until PB0 is pressed.
