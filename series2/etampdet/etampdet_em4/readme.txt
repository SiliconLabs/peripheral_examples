etampdet_em4

This project demonstrates the tamper detection module available on EFR32xG25 and
EFR32xG27. The example uses #defines to enable the ETAMPDET peripheral's
channel 0 and/or channel 1, and requires an external jumper-wire connection
between the ETAMPIN0 <-> ETAMPOUT0 and/or ETAMPIN1 <-> ETAMPOUT1 pins, as
specified in device datasheet and README. The application is configured
similarly to the em4_no_dcdc example, allowing EM4 entry with BURTC with LFXO
_or_ EM4 entry without BURTC utilizing ULFRCO via #define at the beginning of
code. ETAMPDET is enabled for EM4 wakeup. If MCU reset is caused by EM4 wakeup
and ETAMPDET interrupt flag is set, LED0 or LED1 will toggle to indicate the
ETAMPDET tamper event on channel 0 or channel 1, respectively.

Note: Default project gives EM4 current consumption numbers with no BURTC. For 
EM4 current consumption with BURTC running on LFXO, set BURTC_LFXO_EN to 1.

When EFR32xG22 and later devices enter EM2/3, the clock to the CPU debug block 
is stopped, effectively dropping the host OC debugger connection. This examples 
includes an "escape hatch" mechanism to pause the device so that a debugger can
connect in order to erase flash.  To use this, press the PB0 push button and, 
while holding the button, press the RESET button in the lower right corner of 
the WSTK.  Upon releasing the RESET button, the device runs code that sees that 
PB0 is depressed, turns on LED0, and issues a breakpoint instruction to halt the
CPU. At this point, a the debugger connection can be resumed to erase flash, etc

================================================================================

How To Test:
1. Update the kit's firmware from the Simplicity Launcher (if necessary)
2. Using a jumper-wire, electrically connect ETAMPOUT0 to ETAMPIN0 and 
   ETAMPOUT1 to ETAMPIN1
3. Build the project and download to the Wireless Starter Kit, then exit
   from the debugger.
4. Open the Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler. Select Start Energy Capture
   from the Profiler menu and restart the wireless starter kit using Reset Pin.
5. Zoom in on the Y-axis (current) and observe the change in current draw.
6. Remove either jumper-wire
7. Observe LED0 turn on when channel 0 jumper-wire is removed or LED1 turn on 
   when channel 1 jumper-wire is removed, and additional current consumption in 
   Energy Capture as MCU wakes from EM4

Note for Testing on xG25:
Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler tool only measures the VMCU current. On
BRD4270B Rev. A06 and beyond, RFVDD and DVDD are powered by the output of the
DCDC, IOVDD0-1 are powered by VMCU, VREGVDD and AVDD are powered by net VDD, and
IOVDD2 is powered by the VLDO_3V3. To best replicate datasheet test conditions
for current consumption measurements, the VDD and VLDO_3V3 net configurations
need to also be powered by VMCU. Please use the following extra steps:
1. Complete Steps 1 and 2 from the "How to Test" section above.
2. Select the device in the Debug Adapters pane within the Simplicity Studio
   Launcher view. 
2. Select the Documentation tab, then check the Schematic and Layout file 
   resource checkbox. Open the schematic and assembly files for BRD4270B.
3. Resistors R210 and R211 are 0 Ohm resistor jumpers used to select the supply
   configuration for net VDD. By default, R210 is not populated and R211 is
   populated, powering VDD through VLDO_3V6. Search for these resistors in the 
   assembly file to determine their position on the board. These resistors are
   both located on the underside of BRD4270B. 
4. Remove R211 and solder a 0 Ohm resistor to R210.
5. Resistors R202 and R248 are 0 Ohm resistor jumpers used to select the supply
   configuration for net VLDO_3V3. By default, R202 is not populated and R248 is
   populated, powering VLDO_3V3 through onboard LDO. Search for these resistors
   in the assembly file to determine their position on the board. These
   resistors are both located on the underside of BRD4270B. 
6. Remove R248 and solder a 0 Ohm resistor to R202.

Note for Testing on xG27:
On BRD4194A, VMCU is a 3.3V supply that powers AVDD and IOVDD on xG27.
In the datasheet, current consumption test conditions have AVDD and IOVDD
powered by either the DC-DC at 1.8V, an external 1.8V supply, 
or an external 3.0V supply. Due to the design of the radio board, this 
board does not replicate the datasheet test conditions for current consumption,
and the measured value may differ from the datasheet value. 
Additionally, due to the connection of LED1 to ETAMPDET channel 0 input,
additional current consumption will be observed in EM2 with channel 0 enabled
(default setting) and LED1 will "flicker" with the random generated bit stream
from the ETAMPDET peripheral.
