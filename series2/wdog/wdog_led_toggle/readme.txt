wdog_led_toggle

This project demonstrates the functionality of the watchdog timer. It uses
LED0 and a Push-button to indicate the state of the system. LED0 will flash as
long as Push Button 0 is not pressed and the system has not undergone a 
watchdog reset. While Push Button 0 is pressed, LED0 will stop flashing.  If
Push Button 0 is pressed and held through the WDOG timeout period, the watchdog
will trigger a reset. The code looks for a reset source in the beginning of the
execution and if WDOG is found to be the reset source, LED0 is turned on and the
code does not execute any further. Note that once a WDOG reset has occurred, 
the device will continue to reset due to WDOG timeout until pin reset or POR.
This behavior results in a flicker of LED0 with a period equal to the WDOG
timeout period.

Note: Writes to clock enable bits are unnecessary and will have no effect on 
EFR32xG21 devices.

How To Test:
1. Build the project and download to the Starter Kit
2. LED0 should be blinking
3. Press and hold Push Button 0 for a period of 3 seconds
4. LED0 is now ON and not blinking anymore, which is indicative of
   a WDOG reset

Peripherals Used:
WDOG - 2 seconds period
